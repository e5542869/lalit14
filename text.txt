Its my dream to work with DELL and I am Grateful you are offering me such an opportunity. I am thankful to all the Interviewers and team for positive feedback.





But due to some medical situations in my family, I cannot relocate to Hyderabad at present. It may take 6 months or more to resolve the medical issues my Parents are into and then only I’ll be available to relocate to Hyderabad.



My mother actually met with an accident months ago. Some biker hit her and she got her left temporal bone broken and also got serious injuries to her brain. She is fine now but still facing lot of complications because of brain injuries. She has a surgery pending and will take some time to properly heal up.

My father is also having a surgery planned in coming months. Almost every week, I am visiting the doctor for consultation.

From Hyderabad it will be little difficult to manage all these.



I had applied in DELL  keeping in view new work from home policy but from Prashant I came to know that is rolled out in US only. And Noida you are not giving to anyone.



So if you could allow me to continue Remote work for an year more from now, I’ll be happy to join. I just need some time to settle all medical issues here and then will relocate to Hyderabad happily.
